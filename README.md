# CS-340 Client Server Development

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by creating solutions that work well together. This means following best practices for code structure, using meaningful variable names, writing clear and concise comments, and ensuring that my code is modular and reusable.

# What are the advantages of working in this way?
The advantages of working in this way include:
- **Easier Maintenance**: Identifying and fixing incorrect components is straightforward.
- **Code Reusability**: Solutions can be reused in different projects, saving time and effort.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Code is easier for others to understand and contribute to.

# How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
In the future, I could use the CRUD Python module by:
- **Writing Testable Code**: Including test conditions to ensure the accuracy of my code solutions.
- **Error Handling**: Finding and addressing errors efficiently to maintain robust applications.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems with a technical mindset, leveraging my knowledge and available resources. For client requests, I break down the problem into manageable parts and utilize appropriate solutions, such as pymongo, to streamline the process and achieve efficient outcomes.

# How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
My approach to this project differed in the way I made design decisions. I focused more on the practical application and integration of various components to create a cohesive and functional solution.

# What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
In the future, I would use NoSQL databases to create flexible and scalable solutions tailored to client needs. This includes:
- **Designing for Scalability**: Ensuring the database can grow with the application's requirements.
- **Optimizing for Performance**: Using efficient data structures and indexing to enhance performance.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve and identify complex problems using advanced technology. This work matters because it connects creativity and science to improve computational systems, leading to innovative solutions and advancements in various fields.

# How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Projects like this can help a company locate important information quickly by:
