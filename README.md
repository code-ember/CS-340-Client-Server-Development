# CS-340-Project

- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by creating solutions that are compatible together from the code that I created.

- What were the advantages of working in this way? The advantage of working in this way is by having compatible code solutions and being able to identify incorrect components and reuse code solutions easily.

- How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? Another way of using CRUD Python module in the future is by writing testable code that have test conditions and finding all the errors in my code solutions.

- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? My approached this problem as a computer scientist is having a technical mindset by using the knowledge and resources that were given to help me solve this problem efficiently. I will approach the client request by breaking down the problem and using the available solutions that are available to me at that time like pymongo to help streamline the code solution.

- How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? My approach to this project varies in a way my design decisions were made.

- What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? The methods that I would use the NoSQL databases in the future to create databases to meet and fulfill other client requests.

- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? Computer scientists help solve and identify complex problems with technology in advanced ways. This matters because it is work that uses the connection of creativity and science to improve computers.

- How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? Project types like this one can help a company locate important information quickly by working with the database and dashboard design to make their work even better than before.
